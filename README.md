# Overview

This program is the blackjack card game.  It allows the user to get two cards and decide if they would like to hit or stay.  Once they are finished making a decision then their total is put up against the dealer to determine who wins the game.  This program allowed me to learn the syntax of the C++ language and push me to create a working game.

# Development Environment

In order to develop this program I worked in Visual Studio Code using the C++ extension and the Code Runner extension.  This allowed me to use C++ in VS Code and run the code.
Inside of my C++ file I also used some libraries to help with my coding including iostream, cstdlib and ctime.  These allowed me to read input from a user, output, use math functions and also work the the clock to determine when an action happened.

# Future Work

* Need to add a split card function.
* You are able to hit when get two ones at the start and choose to make them both 11 resulting in a bust.
* Create functions for when I have repeated code.
